# Roadmap

## UX
 * Minimize button shows different icons or highlighting
 * Layout of buttons on person options screen

## Groups

 * Groups can be defined as having particular roles/skills
 * Parse posts from Lemmy groups
 * Think of a way to display groups. Maybe assign a hashtag and display them like hashtag timelines

## Questions

 * Still not implemented ideally
 * Instance-only questions
 * Active polls screen?
 * Questions more integrated into overall organization

## Code

 * More unit test coverage
 * Unit test for federated shared items
 * Break up large functions into smaller ones
 * Architecture diagrams
 * Code documentation?
