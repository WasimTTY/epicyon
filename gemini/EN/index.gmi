Epicyon is an AGPL licensed ActivityPub protocol compliant federated social network server suitable for hosting a small number of accounts on low power systems requiring minimal maintenance, such as single board computers. It's the ActivityPub equivalent of an email server, storing posts as human readable JSON on file, rather than in a database. It also uses only a small amount of RAM.

## An Internet of People, Not Corporate Agendas

Epicyon is written in Python with a HTML+CSS web interface and uses no javascript which makes display in a web browser very lightweight. It can run as a Progressive Web App on mobile. Just say "no" to boring social media sites packed with generic adverts and zombified corporate influencers.

Emojis, hashtags, photos, video and audio attachments, instance and account level blocking controls, moderation functions and reports are all supported. Build the community you want and avoid the stuff you don't. No ads. No blockchains or other Silicon Valley garbage.

## Community not Audience

Corporate social media gives you an audience, with reach, celebrity, spectacle, lack of control, professional influencers, anxiety, alienation and competition. It's designed for fast growth regardless of social consequences. Epicyon is designed for community, in which you have voice, agency, discussions and comradery. The community approach is the better way to build a habitable internet for the long term.
